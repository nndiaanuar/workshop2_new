Ah, I see! So the refund process you're describing is for situations where a concert is canceled because the minimum ticket sales (e.g., 300 tickets) haven't been met. In this case, the system would automatically refund the users who purchased tickets.
To implement this feature, you would likely need to track ticket sales for each concert. If the total sales fall below the minimum threshold (300 tickets), the concert would be marked as canceled, and the system would trigger a refund to all ticket purchasers.
You could update the refund logic to reflect this scenario:
Track ticket sales for each concert.
Check if the sales meet the minimum requirement (300 tickets).
Cancel the concert automatically if the sales are below the minimum.
Trigger an automatic refund for all users who purchased tickets for that concert.
This system would require integration with your ticket purchasing process and a refund mechanism that triggers when a concert is canceled due to low sales.
